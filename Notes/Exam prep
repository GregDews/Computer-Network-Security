    2.8 What are the principal ingredients of a public-key cryptosystem? 
    2.10 What is the difference between a private key and a secret key? 
    2.11 What is a digital signature? 2.12 What is a public-key certificate? 
    2.13 How can public-key encryption be used to distribute a secret key?

    Problem A(based on 2/E Textbook, Page 104, 3.5)A phonetic password generator picks two segments randomly for each six-letter password. The form of each segment is CVC (consonant, vowel, consonant), where V =<a, e, i, o, u>and C = 
    a. What is the total password population? 
    b. What is the probability of an adversary guessing a password correctly(use scientific annotation and keep 3 significant digits)

    Problem B(based on Textbook, Page 104, 3.6)Assume that passwords are limited to the use of the 95 printable ASCII characters and that all passwords are 10 characters in length. Assume a password cracker with an encryption rate of 6.4 million encryptions per second. 
    How long will it take to test exhaustively all possible passwords ona UNIX system(unit: years)?
    (Hint: To keep it simple, just assumed that (1) the salt is either not used or for one given hashed password with the given salt; (2) one encryption means run the hash routine once.)
