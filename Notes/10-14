Access control
    basic elements
        subject - entity capable of accessing objects
            user/application is representedted by a process to gain access to an object
            often define three classes: owner, group, world(other)
        object - resource ot which access is controlled
            used to contain / recieve information
            files, ports, data, programs, etc
        access right - descrives the way in which a subject may access an object
            read/write(including read), execute, delete, create, search(ls)

    Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
        scheme in which an entity may enable another entity to access some resource
    
        Access Matrix (Objects x User) each element has bits for rights
            could be database, linked list, 2d array, different ways to implement

            Access Control List (ACLs)
                linked list of subjects for each file
                may contain a default but must follow least power or read only
            Capability tickets
                each user has a list of objects and their rights
            Authorization Table for Files
                more convenient than ACLs
                one row for one access right of one subject on one object

        General Logic Model
            protection state
                set of information that specifies the access rights for each subject with respect to each object
                allows subjects to alter the protection state in certain ways

                Processes - access rights include the ability to delete a process, stop(block), wake up
                Devices - Access rights include ability to read/write the device, control it's operation
                Memory locations and regions - certain areas are protected from read/write form certain users
                Subjects - ability to grant or delete access rights for self or other subjects
            
        Access Control Function
            every acces by a subject to an object is mediated bu the controller for that object
            Access matrix monitor handles access control and modification of access matrix
                responds with rights for requested subject and object
                Set of rules are defined in an Access Control System
