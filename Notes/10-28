Unix uses a special list to keep track of permissions
No change in material that she is covering. Talking about chmod values and ways to handle permissions

Extended access control lists
Modern Unix systems:
    FreeBSD - OpenBSD
        Setfacl assigns a list of UNIX user IDs and groups
        owner mask - Can only assign permissions that the owner has
            owner rights AND requested bits -> listed user being granted
        named users and named groups use group class permissions as mask
Role Based Access Control - RBAC
    many users to each role, many roles to each object
    possibly work more dynamically
    role permissions rarely change
